#‚ùì React Quiz App

The **React Quiz App** is a quiz application designed to test your knowledge of React. The app presents users with **30 multiple-choice questions** that cover key concepts and features of React. After completing the quiz, users can see their score based on how many questions they answered correctly.

The app is built using **React** and makes use of the **useReducer** hook for managing the state. This hook is used to handle the quiz logic, such as tracking the user's answers, moving through the questions, and calculating the final score. By using **useReducer**, the app is able to maintain clear and efficient state management, making it scalable and easy to handle more complex quiz logic in the future.

## Key Features
